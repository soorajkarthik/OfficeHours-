The point of Office Hours PLUS is to make it simpler for students to be able to connect with people that will be able to help them with their classes (mentors).

This project will be implemented as a a website that allows for video conferencing and has a queue for students to get one-on-one access to mentors that can help them with 
the class.

The website will have separate tabs for each class that a student can take.

Each class will have separate voice and text channels. 
- The voice channels will be assigned to each mentor with them having a specific room-id that they are able to pull students into.
- The text channels will allow for students to communicate with everyone that is taking the class at the same time.

The website will have an overall general chat for everyone that lets all the users of the software communicate at the same time.

The website will have roles that allow for students to know who is a mentor for what class.
